#  Productivty Pals

## Project Overview
The goal of this project was to create an iOS app where you could share your goals and your progress towards them with your friends, whilst seeing what your friends are working on and support them in their progress. The end goal is that within an account, you can add goals and within each goal, you can upload pictures or videos whenever you make progress on those goals. You could also follow friends and see when they post progress towards their goals, so you can show them support and motivate yourself to make progress towards your own goals. 

## The Progress Made 
- Created welcome screen view, login view and register view and embedded them in a navigation controller to navigate between them
